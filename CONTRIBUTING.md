1. First Fork the Project.
2. Clone the project using the command: `git clone https://github.com/fkkarakurt/nerve`
3. Open it for your favorite code editor and review the code structures. You can develop whatever you want. You can also search for solutions to the problems in the [Issue](https://github.com/fkkarakurt/Nerve/issues) section. It would be great.
4. You can compile files with the `make all` command.
5. I am developing the project using Visual Studio Code. I recommend using the [`Prettier`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) plugin. So we can work in a more understandable way.

### For Windows Users

- You may encounter problems with the `getopt.h` library. For this, you can include the `getopt.h` library at the [link](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/include/getopt.h) below into your project.
